## 🔬 Testability with Upcoming Surveys

### DESI (2026)
- w₀ = -1.016 ± 0.03 (testable at ~0.5σ)
- Combined with BAO, redshift-space distortions: 2-3σ detectability

### Euclid (2027-2028)
- w(z) evolution over 0 < z < 2
- Independent confirmation/refutation

### Roman Space Telescope (2028-2029)
- High-precision SNe Ia distances
- Cross-check Λ(z) predictions

### Falsification Criteria
- If w₀ < -1.05 or w₀ > -0.98 → ruled out
- If no Λ(z) evolution detected → geometric dilution falsified
- If Lyα tension worsens with better data → need major revision

## 🔗 Connection to Main Repository

These papers emerge from the broader **Fractal Reality Framework**:

**Fundamental equation:**
```
∞ → • → ∞'
```
Infinite possibility flows through the ultimate aperture, creating boundary operators that validate finite patterns.

**Validation process:**
```
∇ → [ICE] → ℰ
```
Convergence → Interface validation → Emergence

**See main repository for:**
- 12-layer manuscript (`manuscript/` folder)
- Simulation code (`simulations/` folder)
- Empirical analysis (`analysis/` folder)
