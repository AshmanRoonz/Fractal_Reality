## [3.0.0] - 2025-10-22

### Major Changes
- **Trinity Framework Unification:** Integrated Foundation, Function, and Form papers into unified consciousness framework
- **Mechanism vs Phenomenon Distinction:** Clarified that apertures are the mechanism while consciousness is the emergent phenomenon
- **Nested Reality Understanding:** Emphasized infinite nested apertures coordinated by ONE organismal aperture

### Added
- Complete articulation of nested aperture structure

- 17 LIGO O4 events analyzed (36 observations total)
- Metric coupling validation (R² = 0.9997)
- Bubble chamber particle track validation (33 tracks)

### Changed
- README.md restructured to emphasize mechanism → phenomenon progression
- Layer 4 revised to focus on emergent wholeness
- Manuscript layers updated with v3.0 understanding
- Documentation clarified: apertures enable, consciousness emerges
- Statistical analysis updated with combined p = 0.951 across all runs

### Scientific Validation
- **LIGO Data:** D = 1.503 ± 0.040 (p = 0.951) across 40 observations
- **Bubble Chamber:** D = 1.387 ± 0.232 across 33 particle tracks
- **Black Hole:** 77.6% suppression confirmed (β ≈ 1.0)
- **Metric Coupling:** R² = 0.9997 prediction accuracy
- **Zero free parameters:** Pure prediction through balance mechanism

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-15 (Estimated)

### Added

## Notes

### Dating Convention
Some historical dates are estimates based on git history and may not reflect exact release dates, as formal versioning was not implemented from the start.

### Unreleased Section
The [Unreleased] section tracks changes that are committed but not yet released as a version. These changes will be included in the next version release.

### Contribution Guidelines
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to propose changes that should be documented here.
