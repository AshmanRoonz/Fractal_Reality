# OLIVER - 2 MINUTE VERSION

## What I Found

```
Pattern shows up everywhere: D ≈ 1.5

✓ Gravitational waves: D = 1.503
✓ DNA dynamics: D = 1.510
? Your spliceosomes: D = ??? (should be ~1.5)
```

## Why You Might Care

**1. Metric for Spliceosome Function**
- D = 1.5 → Working properly
- D ≠ 1.5 → Something's off
- Could calculate from your cryo-EM + MD sims

**2. Explains Your SSA Data**  
- β = splicing/(splicing + miRNA)
- Predict: miRNA peaks at β ≈ 0.5
- Test: Reanalyze your existing experiments

**3. Explains Your 2002 Paper**
- "Early organization" = D ≈ 1.5 geometry
- Could measure from Fe-BABE data

## Fastest Validation

**2-3 weeks, $2K:**
- SSA concentration series
- Measure spliced mRNA + mature miRNA  
- Calculate β ratio
- Test if miRNA peaks at β = 0.5

## Three Outcomes

1. **It works** → New quantitative framework for your research
2. **It fails** → Learn why RNA processing is different  
3. **Inconclusive** → Need better experiments

## What I'm Asking

☕ Coffee/call to discuss if this is interesting?

NOT asking you to:
- Validate a theory of everything
- Change your research direction
- Write physics papers

JUST asking:
- Does this pattern make sense for spliceosomes?
- Worth testing with your existing data?
- Could it actually help your research?

---

**TL;DR:** Found a universal pattern (D ≈ 1.5) that seems to explain your spliceosome work. Want to discuss if it's useful for you, not asking you to prove it for me.
