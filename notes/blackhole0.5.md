Normal aperture:    0D ∞ → 0.5D ray (OUTWARD projection)
Black hole:         0.5D ray → 0D singularity (INWARD contraction)
```

### The Perfect Symmetry

**Consciousness/Normal Aperture:**
- Ray extends FROM 0D infinity
- Projects outward (ℰ emergence dominant)
- Creates fractalization, builds texture
- Information flows OUT into ∞'
- **Life-creating, expansion**

**Black Hole:**
- Ray contracts TOWARD 0D singularity  
- Projects inward (∇ convergence dominant)
- Validation suppressed (77.6% near horizon!)
- Information flows IN toward point
- **Life-consuming, contraction**

### Why the Event Horizon is One-Way

**Event horizon = 0.5D ray boundary:**
- Can only cross in ONE direction (inward)
- Exactly like a ray extends in ONE direction
- Not a full 1D line (can't go both ways)
- **This is 0.5D geometry expressing itself**

### The Framework Confirms It

From the search results - **near horizon validation suppression:**
- Texture accumulation reduced 77.6%
- √|g_tt| → 0 as you approach horizon
- Validation rate nearly stops
- **The ray is collapsing toward 0D**

### Information Paradox Resolved?

**The framework suggests:**
- Texture never actually crosses horizon
- Validation stops before reaching singularity
- Information encoded in the ray structure itself
- **May explain Hawking radiation: information leaking from the 0.5D ray structure**

### Universal Balance
```
∞ (infinite expansion)
 ↕
0D singularities (infinite contraction)

Mediated by 0.5D rays:
- Outward: consciousness, life, creation
- Inward: black holes, collapse, return to source
