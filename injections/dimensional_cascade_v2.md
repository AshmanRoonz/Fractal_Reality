## Detailed Equations by Dimension

### 0D — Pure Energy (Structure)

**What it is:** Pre-structure potential. Undifferentiated energy before entering the aperture tunnel.

**Core equations:**
```
E = mc²                    Energy-mass equivalence
E = ℏω                     Energy-frequency relation  
H = E                      Pure-energy Hamiltonian (bare, no structure yet)
U(t) = exp(−iEt/ℏ)         Time evolution operator
```

**Physical meaning:** The "fuel" that exists before any structure. No extension, no rotation — pure capacity for becoming.

---

### 0.5D — Aperture / Soul (Process)

**What it is:** The tunnel opening itself. A singularity that *causes* tunneling. The soul IS this aperture.

**Core equations:**
```
i² = −1                    Defining property
Å(β) = exp(iπβ)            Generalized aperture operator

Balance condition:
β = |≻| / (|≻| + |⊰|) = ½  Symmetry between convergence and emergence

Shannon entropy of balance:
H(β) = −[β log₂ β + (1−β) log₂(1−β)]
H(½) = 1 bit               Maximum uncertainty = perfect balance

At β = 0.5:
  Å(0.5) = exp(iπ/2) = i   The imaginary unit IS the balanced aperture
  θ = πβ = π/2 = 90°       Rotation angle
  |Å| = 1                  Magnitude conserved
```

**Physical meaning:** The minimal structure where rotation becomes possible without translation. Enough to turn, not enough to move.

---

### 1D — Timeline / String (Structure)

**What it is:** The soul extended through time. The tunnel through which power flows.

**Core equations:**
```
i(t): t → •(t)             Soul's worldline (aperture parameterized by time)
γ: ℝ → M                   Worldline in spacetime manifold M

P = dE/dt                  Power = energy flow rate through tunnel
P ≈ ΔE/Δt                  Discrete version

ds² = −c²dt² + dx²         Proper time along worldline
S = ∫ L dt                 Action along the string
```

**Physical meaning:** This is the worldline in relativity, the string in string theory. The tunnel itself, not just its opening.

---

### 1.5D — Spatial Branching (Process)

**What it is:** How 1D power lines fractally split in space to build 2D surfaces.

**Core equations:**
```
Fractal dimension from balance:
D = 1 + ½H(β)
At β = 0.5: H(½) = 1 bit → D = 1 + ½(1) = 1.5

Kernel from balance parameter:
K(r) ∝ r^α,  α = β         Exponent equals balance
At β = 0.5: K(r) ∝ r^0.5 = √r

Aperture density scaling:
  ρ << ρ_c  →  D → 2-3     Underconstrained (diffuse)
  ρ = ρ_c   →  D = 1.5     Critical balance
  ρ >> ρ_c  →  D → 1       Overconstrained (collapsed)

Mean displacement:
⟨r²(t)⟩ ∝ t^(2/D) = t^(4/3)   Superdiffusive scaling
H_Hurst = 1/D = 2/3            Hurst exponent
```

**Physical meaning:** This is HOW bodies grow. Trees, lungs, vasculature, neurons, rivers, lightning — all D ≈ 1.5 because they're performing this branching process.

---

### 2D — Surface / Body (Structure)

**What it is:** Boundary, interface, membrane. The body. What branching crystallizes into.

**Core equations:**
```
○ ∈ 𝔅                      Boundary as element of configuration space
Σ ↪ M                      2-surface embedded in spacetime
Σ = ∂V                     Boundary OF a volume (inside/outside distinction)

∂○/∂t = ε                  Slow boundary evolution (ε small)
ℋ_○ = L²(𝔅, dμ_○)          Hilbert space of boundary states

Gauss's law (boundary↔volume):
∮_○ Φ · dA = ∫_V (∇·Φ) dV
```

**Physical meaning:** The membrane that separates inside from outside. Optimal D = 1.5 branching builds and maintains these 2D surfaces.

---

### 2.5D — Sensation (Process)

**What it is:** Where body and field actually touch. Raw contact. The interface band of lived experience.

**Core equations:**
```
Local contact transmission (micro-level phase gating):
T_local(x) = cos²(Δφ_contact(x)/2)

  — This is the coupling at the body↔field interface
  — Phase alignment → high transmission (sensation passes)
  — Phase orthogonality → zero transmission (blocked)

Triple validation gate:
Accept ≡ [•(pattern) > θ_•]      Soul threshold
     AND [○(pattern) > θ_○]      Body threshold  
     AND [Φ(pattern) > θ_Φ]      Mind threshold

All three must pass for sensation to register.

Dimensional origin:
D = 2 + 0.5 = 2.5          Surface + aperture texture
```

**Physical meaning:** This IS sensation — "something happened at the interface." The triple gate ensures only coherent patterns pass through to become experience.

---

### 3D — Perceptual Field (Structure)

**What it is:** Manifest inner volume. Perception as structured field on the "imaginary" side of i.

**Core equations:**
```
Discrete tick (full gated form):
Φ(t+Δt) = ⊱ ∘ V_out ∘ i ∘ V_in ∘ ≺[Φ(t)] + ε

Where:
  ≺[Φ]     = ∫ K_conv(r'',r') Φ(r') d³r'     Convergence
  V_in     = field-level implementation of triple validation gate (input)
  i        = aperture rotation (90° at β = ½)
  V_out    = field-level implementation of triple validation gate (output)
  ⊱[χ]     = ∫ K_emerg(r,r'') χ(r'') d³r''   Emergence
  ε        = noise/fluctuation term

Validation operators:
  V_in, V_out : ℋ_Φ → ℋ_Φ
  V_in[Φ]  = Φ restricted to patterns passing 2.5D triple gate on input
  V_out[χ] = χ restricted to patterns passing 2.5D triple gate on output

Continuous limit (Schrödinger):
iℏ ∂Φ/∂t = HΦ = −(ℏ²/2m)∇²Φ + V(x)Φ

Field space:
Φ ∈ Γ(E)                   Section of vector bundle E → M
ℋ_Φ = L²(M, d⁴x; ℂ⁶⁴)      64-state Hilbert space
```

**Physical meaning:** The organized inner world — shapes, objects, space as experienced. Structured patterns on the "imaginary" extension of the body.

---

### 3.5D — Tunnel Braiding (Process)

**What it is:** Soul-tunnels weaving together. Where worldlines become shared history.

**Core equations:**
```
Effective phase coupling between apertures (macro-level):
T_eff,ij = cos²(Δφ_ij/2)

  — Coarse-grained coupling between braided soul-tunnels
  — Distinct from T_local at 2.5D (micro body↔field contact)

Coherence condition:
Δφ_ij ≈ 0 for all i,j in coherent region R

Braid group structure:
B₃ ↪ Aut(Φ)                Braid group embeds in field automorphisms
σᵢσⱼ = σⱼσᵢ  (|i−j| ≥ 2)   Far strands commute
σᵢσᵢ₊₁σᵢ = σᵢ₊₁σᵢσᵢ₊₁      Yang-Baxter equation

The backreaction loop:
Braid → T_μν → g_μν → √|g_tt| → [i-rate] → Braid

  Braid          Worldlines weave
  → T_μν         Creates stress-energy tensor  
  → g_μν         Curves spacetime metric
  → √|g_tt|      Determines redshift/time dilation
  → [i-rate]     Affects aperture clock rate
  → Braid        Feeds back into braiding
```

**Physical meaning:** Where the arrow of becoming shows up as shared history. The loop shows gravity emerging from and feeding back into consciousness.

---

### 4D — Time Braid (Structure)

**What it is:** Woven history. The committed record of choices. Not flowing present but crystallized past.

**Core equations:**
```
Stress-energy from braids:
T_μν^(braid) = ρ_braid u_μ u_ν + p_braid h_μν + ...

Einstein field equations:
G_μν = R_μν − ½g_μν R = (8πG/c⁴) T_μν

Metric-braid link:
B(x) ∝ √(−g_tt(x))         Braid density ∝ redshift factor

Committed braid:
B ∈ B_∞                    Infinite braid of accumulated choices
```

**Physical meaning:** The validation receipts accumulated forever. What happened STAYS happened. The braid is eternal record.

---

### 4.5D — Recursion (Process)

**What it is:** How a complete cycle becomes a seed for the next scale.

**Core equations:**
```
Scale recursion (THE key equation):
4.5D_n = 0D_{n+1}          Whole system at scale n → seed at scale n+1

The helix closes:
[0D → 0.5D → 1D → 1.5D → 2D → 2.5D → 3D → 3.5D → 4D → 4.5D]_n = 0D_{n+1}

Notation:
  ⊙  = the general circumpunct object
  ⊙* = the attractor fixed-point solution

Fixed-point universe:
⊙* = fix(λΦ. ⊱ ∘ i ∘ ≺[Φ])

Attractor:
lim_{n→∞} T_⊙^n [Φ₀] = ⊙*   Repeated update converges to fixed point

RG flow:
∂⊙/∂s = β(⊙)               Renormalization in scale parameter s
```

**Physical meaning:** Parts have parts have parts. Each complete system is a single aperture event at the next scale up. This is how infinity nests within finite structure.

## Key Constants (Zero Free Shape Parameters)

All internal exponents and angles are fixed by β = 0.5 (balance) and its consequences.
No ad-hoc shape parameters are introduced by hand.

| Symbol | Value | Derivation |
|--------|-------|------------|
| β | 0.5 | Symmetry: \|≻\| = \|⊰\| |
| H(β) | 1 bit | H(½) = −[½ log₂ ½ + ½ log₂ ½] = 1 |
| D | 1.5 | D = 1 + ½H(β) = 1 + ½(1) |
| θ | π/2 = 90° | θ = πβ = π(½) |
| i | exp(iπ/2) | Å(β) = exp(iπβ) at β = 0.5 |
| α | 0.5 | Kernel exponent = β |
| H_Hurst | 2/3 | H = 1/D = 1/1.5 |
| 64 | 8×8 | Input states × output states |

---

## The Core Insight

```
β = |≻| / (|≻| + |⊰|) = ½

Convergence = Emergence
What comes in = What goes out
Autonomy = Integration  
Private = Shared

This single ratio generates:
  • The imaginary unit (i = exp(iπ/2))
  • The fractal dimension (D = 1.5)
  • The kernel shape (K ∝ √r)
  • The phase transmission law (T = cos²(Δφ/2))
  • The entire dimensional architecture

The rest is just unpacking what balance implies.
```
