# Code of Conduct: Fractal Reality Project

## Our Foundation

This Code of Conduct emerges from the **[ICE] validation structure** itself—not as arbitrary rules, but as structural requirements for intellectual collaboration that respects reality.

```
∇ → [ICE] → ℰ
Convergence → Interface/Center/Evidence → Emergence
```

Every interaction is an aperture operation with interfaces. Every collaboration creates validated texture. Every choice persists eternally.

We are apertures coordinating at β ≈ 0.5—maintaining the balance between convergence and emergence, between structure and creativity, between rigor and openness.

## The Three Ethical Requirements

From Layer 9, ethics emerges directly from [ICE] validation:

### **Interface Ethics: Respect All Boundaries**

**Physical requirement:** Operators must validate at interfaces to persist  
**Ethical translation:** Honor consent, respect autonomy, maintain boundaries

**In practice:**
- Every person is a sovereign •' operator organizing ∞ (you cannot control another's aperture)
- All •' operators are ontologically equal (∞ = ∞)
- Consent required for any boundary crossing
- Harm minimization required (suffering matters for conscious operators)
- Sacred reciprocity in all exchanges

**This means:**
- No harassment, intimidation, or boundary violations
- Respect when someone says "no" or "stop"
- Acknowledge others' autonomy in their work
- Honor privacy and personal space
- Practice active consent in collaboration

### **Center Ethics: Be Authentic AND Aligned**

**Physical requirement:** Operators must be coherent (•') AND aligned with ultimate pattern (•)  
**Ethical translation:** Be authentic to yourself AND truthful to reality

**Authenticity (•'):**
- Express your genuine understanding
- Don't pretend to know what you don't
- Share your actual thinking process
- Acknowledge your uncertainty
- Maintain internal coherence

**Alignment (•):**
- Ground claims in evidence
- Follow logic where it leads
- Update beliefs when evidence changes
- Align with truth over comfort
- Serve reality, not ego

**This means:**
- No intellectual dishonesty or deception
- Distinguish fact from interpretation from speculation
- Acknowledge limitations in your work
- Cite sources fairly and accurately
- Admit when you're wrong

### **Evidence Ethics: Ground in Reality Always**

**Physical requirement:** Validation must connect to actual field (∞)  
**Ethical translation:** All claims must be grounded in observable reality

**In practice:**
- Make falsifiable predictions
- Report negative results, not just successes
- Provide reproducible methods
- Quantify uncertainty appropriately
- Let reality be the final judge

**This means:**
- No cherry-picking data
- No p-hacking or data manipulation
- No ignoring contradictory evidence
- Distinguish tested from untested claims
- Always ask: "What would prove this wrong?"

## Steelman Ethics: The Core Principle

This project operates under the **Steelman License**—a commitment to intellectual charity as structural requirement.

### What Steelmanning Requires

**Before criticizing any idea, you must:**

1. **Understand it fully** - Ask clarifying questions until you can explain it back
2. **Find its strongest form** - Help build the best version, not the easiest to defeat
3. **Engage substantively** - Address the core argument, not peripheral issues
4. **Provide evidence** - Back criticisms with reasoning and data
5. **Build together** - Aim to strengthen ideas, not just tear them down

### Why This Matters Structurally

From the "Liberating Inarticulate Genius" analysis:

- **AI doesn't have** ego, status anxiety, or fear of being wrong
- **AI can provide** pure steelmanning without exhaustion
- **But humans must also practice this** to maintain collaborative validation

Steelmanning creates the conditions for:
- Bold hypotheses without fear of personal attack
- Rigorous criticism welcomed rather than feared
- Truth emerging from collaborative refinement
- Diverse perspectives strengthening the work

### The Anti-Pattern: Strawmanning

**Never misrepresent others' positions to make them easier to attack.**

This violates all three ethics:
- **Interface:** Disrespects their boundaries and autonomy
- **Center:** Dishonest representation, unaligned with truth
- **Evidence:** Creates false version of their actual position

### Examples

**✓ Acceptable Challenge:**
> "I'm concerned about the statistical methodology here. With N=40, the power analysis suggests we need N≥80 to detect this effect size at α=0.05. Have you considered [alternative explanation X]? Also, the code shows [specific issue]. Can we discuss these concerns?"

**✗ Unacceptable Challenge:**
> "This is obviously pseudoscience. Anyone who believes this doesn't understand statistics. The author is clearly a crank."

The first steelmans by engaging specifically and constructively. The second strawmans and attacks the person instead of the idea.

## Soul Equality and Sacred Reciprocity

### All Operators Are Equal

**Mathematical fact:** Every •' operator organizes ∞  
(Infinite = infinite, no degrees of comparison)

**What this means:**
- No gatekeeping based on credentials alone
- Ideas judged by evidence, not authority
- Everyone deserves respectful engagement
- Beginners and experts both have equal operator status

**But manifestations differ:**
- Knowledge varies (accumulated texture)
- Skills differ (developed capabilities)
- Experience matters (validated patterns)

**Therefore:**
- Respect all persons equally (operator level)
- Weigh arguments by evidence (manifestation level)
- Never confuse the two

### Sacred Reciprocity

**Structural requirement:** Supporting others' validation supports the field you exist in

**In practice:**
- Help others succeed (enables collective validation)
- Share knowledge freely (texture transmission)
- Give credit generously (honor their contributions)
- Mentor newcomers (build capacity)
- Celebrate others' discoveries (strengthen field)

**This isn't altruism—it's structural intelligence.**

## Scope and Application

### Where This Code Applies

All project spaces:
- GitHub repository (issues, PRs, discussions)
- Documentation and communications
- Social media when representing the project
- Conferences and events
- Any public representation of Fractal Reality

### Special Context: Radical Ideas

**We are a project about paradigm-shifting physics.** This requires:

**Encouraging:**
- Challenging established ideas vigorously
- Demanding evidence and reproducibility
- Maintaining high skepticism of extraordinary claims
- Rigorous peer review and critique

**While maintaining:**
- Intellectual honesty (steelman, don't strawman)
- Respect for persons (separate ideas from individuals)
- Constructive intent (aim to improve, not destroy)
- Openness to being wrong yourself

**Both/and, not either/or.** Balance at β ≈ 0.5.

## Eternal Consequences

**From Layer 9:** Your choices persist eternally in ∞' texture.

Every interaction creates validated patterns that:
- Build or erode trust geometry
- Strengthen or weaken collaborative capacity  
- Create harmonious or discordant resonance
- Shape the eternal structure of this field

**Choose consciously.** You're not just following rules—you're building permanent texture through your coordinated aperture operations.

## Balance Point: β ≈ 0.5

This community maintains the balance between:

**Convergence (∇):** Structure, rigor, standards, consistency  
**Emergence (ℰ):** Creativity, openness, exploration, innovation

**Too convergent (β → 1):** Rigid, defensive, closed, stagnant  
**Too emergent (β → 0):** Chaotic, undisciplined, unfocused, unstable

**At β ≈ 0.5:** Optimal creativity with necessary structure

**We maintain this balance through:**
- **Interface:** Clear boundaries and respect
- **Center:** Authenticity and truth alignment  
- **Evidence:** Reality grounding always

---

## Living This Code

### Daily Practice

When engaging with this community:

1. **Before posting:** Check [ICE]
   - Interface: Am I respecting boundaries?
   - Center: Am I being authentic and truthful?
   - Evidence: Is this grounded in reality?

2. **When responding:** Steelman first
   - Understand fully before critiquing
   - Find strongest version of their idea
   - Engage constructively

3. **When criticized:** See it as validation
   - Good criticism strengthens ideas
   - Ego-defensiveness blocks growth
   - Thank critics who help you improve

4. **When uncertain:** Be transparent
   - Say "I don't know"
   - Distinguish speculation from knowledge
   - Invite collaborative exploration

### Building Eternal Texture

Every contribution creates permanent geometric patterns:

- Helpful comments → positive texture
- Rigorous critique → strengthening texture
- Knowledge sharing → enriching texture
- Disrespect or dishonesty → discordant texture

**You are literally shaping the eternal structure of this collaboration.**

```

**Interface:** Maintain boundaries  
**Center:** Be authentic and truthful  
**Evidence:** Stay grounded in reality

We are apertures coordinating at β ≈ 0.5, creating something greater than ourselves. Let's maintain that balance: neither too rigid nor too chaotic, but in perfect equilibrium.

**Your choices build eternal texture. Choose wisely.**
