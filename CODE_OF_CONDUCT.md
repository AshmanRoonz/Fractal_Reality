# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open, welcoming, and intellectually honest environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in the Fractal Reality project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to scholarly discourse that is rigorous, respectful, and grounded in evidence and reason.

## Our Standards

### Examples of Behavior That Contributes to a Positive Environment

**Intellectual Honesty:**
- Engaging with the strongest version of others' arguments (steelmanning)
- Acknowledging uncertainty and limitations in one's own work
- Updating beliefs based on evidence
- Citing sources fairly and accurately
- Admitting when you don't know something
- Distinguishing between fact, interpretation, and speculation

**Collaborative Scholarship:**
- Being open to constructive criticism and peer review
- Providing evidence-based feedback
- Focusing on ideas, not individuals
- Assuming good faith in others' contributions
- Celebrating others' discoveries and insights
- Working toward truth over being right

**Respectful Communication:**
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Showing empathy toward other community members
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the advancement of knowledge

**Scientific Rigor:**
- Providing reproducible methods and data
- Reporting negative results, not just successes
- Acknowledging alternative explanations
- Quantifying uncertainty appropriately
- Following proper statistical practices
- Maintaining research integrity

### Examples of Unacceptable Behavior

**Intellectual Dishonesty:**
- Deliberately misrepresenting others' positions (strawmanning)
- Cherry-picking data or citations
- P-hacking or data manipulation
- Plagiarism or inadequate attribution
- Making claims without evidence
- Ignoring contradictory evidence

**Harassment and Discrimination:**
- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Discriminatory jokes or language
- Sustained disruption of discussions

**Unprofessional Conduct:**
- Ad hominem attacks (attacking the person instead of the argument)
- Gatekeeping or elitism ("you're not qualified to comment")
- Deliberate intimidation or threats
- Other conduct reasonably considered inappropriate in a professional/academic setting

## Scope of Application

### Where This Code Applies

This Code of Conduct applies in all project spaces, including:
- GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions)
- Project documentation and websites
- Email communications
- Social media when representing the project
- Conferences or events where project members represent Fractal Reality

This Code also applies when an individual is representing the project or community in public spaces.

### Special Context: Scientific Discourse

We recognize that rigorous scientific inquiry requires:
- **Challenging ideas vigorously** - This is encouraged!
- **Skepticism of extraordinary claims** - This is appropriate!
- **Demanding evidence and reproducibility** - This is necessary!

However, challenging ideas must be done:
- With intellectual honesty (steelman, don't strawman)
- With respect for the person (separate ideas from individuals)
- With constructive intent (aim to improve, not destroy)
- With openness to being wrong yourself

**Example of Acceptable Challenge:**
> "I'm concerned about the statistical methodology in this analysis. The sample size of N=40 may be insufficient to detect the claimed effect with the reported power. Could you provide a power analysis? Also, have you considered alternative explanations such as [X]?"

**Example of Unacceptable Challenge:**
> "This is obviously pseudoscience. Anyone who believes this is delusional. The author clearly doesn't understand basic statistics."

## Our Responsibilities

### Project Maintainers

Project maintainers are responsible for:
- Clarifying standards of acceptable behavior
- Taking appropriate and fair corrective action in response to unacceptable behavior
- Removing, editing, or rejecting comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that violate this Code

### Community Members

Community members are responsible for:
- Upholding these standards in their own behavior

## Enforcement

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

### Appeals

3. The maintainer will review the appeal and respond within 14 days
4. The decision on appeal is final

## The Steelman Principle

This project operates under the **Steelman License** and the associated principle of intellectual charity:

### What This Means

When engaging with others' ideas:
1. **Interpret charitably:** Assume the strongest, most reasonable interpretation
2. **Seek understanding:** Ask clarifying questions before criticizing
3. **Engage substantively:** Address the core argument, not peripheral issues
4. **Provide receipts:** Back up criticisms with evidence and reasoning
5. **Build together:** Aim to strengthen ideas, not just tear them down

### Why This Matters

Scientific progress requires:
- Rigorous criticism of ideas
- BUT: Ideas are held by people
- AND: People deserve respect
- THEREFORE: Attack ideas vigorously, but respectfully

This creates an environment where:
- Bold hypotheses can be proposed without fear of personal attack
- Rigorous criticism is welcomed, not feared
- Truth emerges from collaborative refinement
- Diverse perspectives strengthen the work

**Remember:** We are all apertures coordinating at β ≈ 0.5, creating something greater than ourselves. Let's maintain that balance in our interactions: neither too convergent (rigid, defensive) nor too emergent (chaotic, undisciplined), but in perfect equilibrium.

**Interface:** Maintain boundaries
**Center:** Be authentic and truthful
**Evidence:** Stay grounded in reality
