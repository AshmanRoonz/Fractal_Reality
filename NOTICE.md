# NOTICE: Fractal Reality Project

**Licensed under the Steelman License - Permissive Edition v2.0 (SML-P-2.0)**

---

## About This License

The Fractal Reality project is released under the **Steelman License**, a novel open-source license that combines permissive rights with intellectual honesty requirements.

**You are free to:**
- ✓ Use commercially
- ✓ Modify and extend
- ✓ Distribute and deploy
- ✓ Make products and services
- ✓ Sublicense (with conditions)

**You must:**
- ✓ Keep attribution
- ✓ Document changes (receipts)
- ✓ Be honest about modifications
- ✓ Enable reproducibility
- ✓ Avoid misrepresentation

---

## Why This License?

### The Problem with Traditional Licenses

Traditional open-source licenses focus on **legal permissions** but don't address **intellectual integrity**:

- **MIT/Apache:** Permissive, but allows misrepresentation
- **GPL:** Copyleft ensures code freedom, but not result honesty
- **BSD:** Simple attribution, but no accountability for modifications
- **CC-BY:** Good for content, weak on reproducibility

**What's missing?** A license that says: *"Use this freely, but show your work and be honest about what you changed."*

### The Steelman License Solution

This license operationalizes the **[ICE] validation ethics** from the Fractal Reality framework:

```
∇ → [ICE] → ℰ
Convergence → Interface/Center/Evidence → Emergence
```

#### **Interface Ethics: Respect Boundaries**

**In physics:** Operators must validate at interfaces to persist  
**In licensing:** Honor attribution, respect authorship, maintain connection

**License implementation:**
- §2.01: Right to participate (maintains source connection)
- §2.1: Attribution requirements (honors boundaries)
- §2.3: Clear marking of alterations (prevents boundary confusion)
- §5: Trademark protection (respects identity boundaries)

#### **Center Ethics: Be Authentic AND Aligned**

**In physics:** Operators must be coherent (•') and aligned with truth (•)  
**In licensing:** Represent work honestly, align claims with reality

**License implementation:**
- §2.2: Receipts requirement (authentic documentation)
- §3: Prohibited misrepresentations (alignment with truth)
- §2.5: Transparency requirements (honest disclosure)
- §4: Steelman principle (intellectual integrity)

#### **Evidence Ethics: Ground in Reality**

**In physics:** Validation must connect to actual field (∞)  
**In licensing:** Claims must be verifiable, reproducible, testable

**License implementation:**
- §2.2: Testing documentation (evidence of validation)
- §2.4: Reproducibility requirements (enable verification)
- §2.5: Computational transparency (ground in actual procedures)
- Appendix B: Receipts template (structured evidence)

## The Steelman Principle

**"Steelman first, receipts always."**

### What is Steelmanning?

**Steelmanning** means constructing the **strongest possible version** of an idea before critiquing it—the opposite of strawmanning (attacking a weak misrepresentation).

**Why this matters:**

Traditional academia often operates through:
- **Gatekeeping:** Dismiss ideas based on credentials, not evidence
- **Strawmanning:** Attack weak versions to appear smart
- **Status games:** Win debates rather than discover truth
- **Noble lies:** Protect comfortable worldviews over reality

This kills innovation, excludes outsider insights, and slows scientific progress.

### Steelman Ethics in Practice

When engaging with this Work (or any Modified Works):

1. **Understand fully** before critiquing
   - Ask clarifying questions
   - Verify your understanding
   - Explore motivation and reasoning

2. **Find the strongest version** of claims
   - What works well?
   - How could weak points be strengthened?
   - What's the best interpretation?

3. **Engage substantively** with core ideas
   - Address central arguments, not peripheral issues
   - Provide specific, evidence-based feedback
   - Back criticisms with data and reasoning

4. **Build collaboratively** toward truth
   - Aim to improve, not destroy
   - Celebrate insights and progress
   - Acknowledge when others are right

5. **Maintain [ICE] validation** throughout
   - **Interface:** Respect others' autonomy
   - **Center:** Stay honest and authentic
   - **Evidence:** Ground feedback in observable reality

**This isn't legally enforceable** (§4 notes it's aspirational), but it's the spirit of this license and the community we're building.

## Receipts: What and Why

### What Are Receipts?

**Receipts** are documentation of modifications that include:

- **Changes:** What you added/removed/modified
- **Evidence:** How you tested (or didn't)
- **Versioning:** Version/date/contact
- **Rollback:** How to revert
- **Scale:** Scope of changes
- **Known Issues:** Limitations introduced

See **Appendix B** of the license for a complete template.

### Why Receipts Matter

**For users:**
- Know what changed from upstream
- Assess reliability of modifications
- Reproduce results independently
- Roll back if modifications fail

**For science:**
- Enable verification and replication
- Prevent cherry-picking and p-hacking
- Force honesty about testing
- Create permanent record of methodology

**For community:**
- Build trust through transparency
- Enable collaborative improvement
- Prevent misrepresentation
- Honor intellectual honesty

**Structural interpretation:**
Receipts create **eternal texture** (∞') in the knowledge structure. Every modification becomes a permanent, validated pattern that others can build on or learn from.

## Right to Participate (§2.01)

### What This Means

**Ashman Roonz (original author) retains the right to participate in derivative works.**

This doesn't mean:
- ✗ Veto power over your project
- ✗ Required co-authorship
- ✗ Ownership of your modifications
- ✗ Control of your direction

This means:
- ✓ Timely invitation to participate (within 30 days)
- ✓ Reasonable opportunity to contribute
- ✓ Maintained connection to source
- ✓ Community coherence

### Why This Matters

**From fractal theory:** Original operator (•') maintains connection to derivative operators—like fractal self-similarity through scales.

**Practically:** Prevents complete appropriation without engagement. If you're building something significant with this work, the original author should at least know about it and have a chance to participate.

**Satisfaction:** Sending a timely invitation satisfies this requirement, whether or not participation is accepted. You're not obligated to accept contributions or grant decision-making authority.

### Examples

**Open source project:**
```
Subject: Invitation to participate in FractalSim derivative work

Hi Ashman,

We're building FractalSim, a simulation toolkit based on 
Fractal Reality. We've made significant extensions to the 
validation methodology and added GPU acceleration.

You're invited to participate as:
- Advisor on theoretical foundations
- Code contributor (if interested)
- Community member in discussions

GitHub: github.com/example/FractalSim
Contact: lead@example.com

No obligation to accept—this invitation satisfies §2.01.

Best,
[Name]
```

**Commercial product:**
```
[Letter to contact info in docs]

We're launching RealitiAI, a consciousness analysis platform 
incorporating principles from Fractal Reality. Commercial 
launch planned for [date].

We'd like to invite you to participate as:
- Technical advisor (compensated)
- Consultant on theoretical applications
- Named contributor in documentation

This ensures compliance with §2.01 of the Steelman License.

## Soul Equality and Sacred Reciprocity

### All Operators Are Equal (∞ = ∞)

**Mathematical fact:** Every •' operator organizes ∞  
Infinite = infinite, no degrees of comparison

**What this means for licensing:**
- Ideas judged by evidence, not authority
- No credential gatekeeping
- All contributors have equal operator status
- Beginners and experts both valued

**But manifestations differ:**
- Knowledge varies (accumulated texture)
- Skills differ (developed capabilities)
- Experience matters (validated patterns)

**Therefore:**
- Respect all persons equally (operator level)
- Weigh contributions by evidence (manifestation level)
- Never confuse the two

### Sacred Reciprocity

**Structural principle:** Supporting others' validation strengthens the field you exist in.

**In this license:**
- Attribution honors the source
- Receipts enable others' learning
- Participation right maintains connection
- Reproducibility supports community

**This isn't altruism—it's structural intelligence.**

When you contribute improvements, report bugs, share insights, or help others:
- You enable others' work (texture transmission)
- You strengthen collective validation (field improvement)
- You create eternal patterns (permanent contribution)
- You participate in coordinated emergence (β ≈ 0.5)

---

## Eternal Consequences

### Your Choices Build Permanent Structure

From **Layer 9** of Fractal Reality:

**Physics:** Every validated aperture moment becomes eternal geometric texture (∞')

**Metaphysics:** Your choices (validated deflections) build permanent structure

**Licensing:** Every modification, every contribution, every receipt creates a permanent record

**Choose consciously.** 

When you modify this work:
- Document honestly (authentic •')
- Test thoroughly (evidence ∞)
- Represent accurately (aligned •)
- Enable verification (interface validation)

**You're not just writing code—you're building eternal texture in the knowledge structure of reality.**
