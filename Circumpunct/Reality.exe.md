What happens when universe runs?

Cycle 1: E → V (0D → 1D via Å₀.₅) \
Cycle 2: V → M (1D → 2D via Å₁.₅, β=0.5 emerges) \
Cycle 3: M → Φ (2D → 3D via Å₂.₅ = Å^∞) \
Cycle 4: Φ ≡ E (topological closure)

## The Universe as a Running Program

---

## Initial Conditions

```
t = 0
seed = 100_100₂ = 36₁₀
Φ₀ = SeedField(36)
⟨β⟩ = undefined
E = E₀
```

---

## Cycle 1: E → V (Dimension 0 → 1)

### Step 1.0: Convergence
```
E₀ ≻ Å₀.₅
```

**Operation:**
```
Input:  E₀ = {potential: ∞, dimension: 0}
Apply:  Å₀.₅ = singular lens
        Converge: ∞ → 1 point
Output: waiting at aperture...
```

**State:**
```
Dimension: 0 → 0.5 (fractional, in process)
Energy: E₀ = 100 (arbitrary units)
β: not yet applicable
```

### Step 1.1: Binary Validation
```
Å₀.₅ validates
```

**Operation:**
```
Question: "Does aperture open?"
Test: E₀ > threshold?
Result: TRUE (100 > 0)
Binary: 1
```

**State:**
```
Validation: PASSED
Binary result: 1 (yes, proceed)
Dimension: still 0.5 (in aperture)
```

### Step 1.2: Emergence
```
Å₀.₅ ⊰ V₁
```

**Operation:**
```
Input: validation = 1
Process: expand singularity to line
Output: V₁ = validation line
```

**State:**
```
Dimension: 0.5 → 1.0 (now structure)
Structure: 1D line with two states {0,1}
Energy: E₀ = 100 (conserved)
Pattern: ⊙ at D=1
```

**Checkpoint 1:**
```
✓ E₀ ≻ Å₀.₅ ⊰ V₁ complete
✓ Dimension: 0 → 1
✓ Validation: binary established
✓ Energy: conserved
```

---

## Cycle 2: V → M (Dimension 1 → 2)

### Step 2.0: Convergence
```
V₁ ≻ Å₁.₅
```

**Operation:**
```
Input: V₁ = line with binary state = 1
Apply: Å₁.₅ = branching lens
       Converge: line → transform point
Output: energy at branching aperture
```

**State:**
```
Dimension: 1 → 1.5 (fractional, in process)
Energy: E = 100
β: initializing...
```

### Step 2.1: Branching Optimization
```
Å₁.₅ = β(1-β)
```

**Operation:**
```
Question: "How to split energy optimally?"
Function: f(β) = β(1-β)
Optimize: ∂f/∂β = 0
Solution: β = 0.5
```

**Mathematical proof:**
```
f(β) = β - β²
f'(β) = 1 - 2β = 0
β = 1/2
f''(β) = -2 < 0 ✓ (maximum)
f(1/2) = 1/4 (max value)
```

**State:**
```
Dimension: 1.5 (at aperture)
β_local = 0.5
⟨β⟩ = 0.5 (first measurement)
Energy split: L=50, R=50
```

### Step 2.2: Energy Distribution
```
E_convergent = β × E = 0.5 × 100 = 50
E_emergent = (1-β) × E = 0.5 × 100 = 50
```

**Binary encoding:**
```
State bits updated:
  Input:  100_100
  Split:  010_010 (balanced branching)
```

### Step 2.3: Emergence
```
Å₁.₅ ⊰ M₂
```

**Operation:**
```
Input: split energy at β=0.5
Process: expand branching → surface
Output: M₂ = matter boundary (2D)
```

**State:**
```
Dimension: 1.5 → 2.0 (now structure)
Structure: 2D surface/boundary
Energy: E = 100 (conserved, but split)
Pattern: ⊙ at D=2
Matter: emergent as boundary
```

**Checkpoint 2:**
```
✓ V₁ ≻ Å₁.₅ ⊰ M₂ complete
✓ Dimension: 1 → 2
✓ Branching: β = 0.5 optimized
✓ Energy: conserved through split
✓ Matter: exists as 2D boundary
```

---

## Cycle 3: M → Φ (Dimension 2 → 3)

### Step 3.0: Convergence
```
M₂ ≻ Å₂.₅
```

**Operation:**
```
Input: M₂ = matter boundary
Apply: Å₂.₅ = fractal lens = Å^∞
       Converge: surface → infinite perspectives
Output: energy at fractal aperture
```

**State:**
```
Dimension: 2 → 2.5 (fractional, in process)
Energy: E = 100
Å-count: Å^∞ = lim[n→∞] Åⁿ
```

### Step 3.1: Infinite Lensing
```
Å₂.₅ = Å^∞ = recursive aperture
```

**Operation:**
```
Å₂.₅ = Å ∘ Å ∘ Å ∘ ... (infinite composition)

Å¹: one perspective
Å²: two perspectives  
Å³: four perspectives
...
Å^∞: infinite perspectives (continuous field)
```

**Fractal structure:**
```
Each point on M₂ becomes:
  - Aperture
  - Containing aperture
  - Containing aperture...
  - Ad infinitum

Self-similar at all scales
```

**State:**
```
Dimension: 2.5 (at fractal aperture)
Perspectives: ∞
β_local: varies continuously
⟨β⟩ = 0.5 (global constraint maintained)
```

### Step 3.2: Field Generation
```
Å^∞: boundary → volume field
```

**Operation:**
```
Process: each aperture generates field
Combine: ∫∫ Å_local d²A
Output: Φ₃ = field filling volume
```

**State:**
```
Field components: ∇Φ, ∇²Φ, ∇×Φ
Topology: connected, simply-connected
Volume: filled (3D)
```

### Step 3.3: Emergence
```
Å₂.₅ ⊰ Φ₃
```

**Operation:**
```
Input: infinite apertures
Process: expand fractal → volume
Output: Φ₃ = field (3D)
```

**State:**
```
Dimension: 2.5 → 3.0 (now structure)
Structure: 3D field volume
Energy: E = 100 (conserved)
Pattern: ⊙ at D=3
Field: fully expressed
```

**Checkpoint 3:**
```
✓ M₂ ≻ Å₂.₅ ⊰ Φ₃ complete
✓ Dimension: 2 → 3
✓ Fractal: Å^∞ implemented
✓ Energy: conserved through infinite distribution
✓ Field: exists as 3D volume
```

---

## Cycle 4: Φ → E (Dimension 3 → 0, Closure)

### Step 4.0: Topological Equivalence
```
Φ₃ ≅ E₀
```

**Operation:**
```
Recognition: 3D field = 0D potential
Topology: volume collapses to point (or vice versa)
Proof: HopfChern(Φ₃) = 1 (single cycle)
```

**State:**
```
Φ₃: realized field
E₀: potential field
Identity: they are the same ⊙
```

### Step 4.1: The Identity
```
E₀ ≻ Å₀.₅ ⊰ V₁ ≻ Å₁.₅ ⊰ M₂ ≻ Å₂.₅ ⊰ Φ₃ = ⊙
```

**Left side (process):**
```
Start: E₀ (0D)
→ Å₀.₅ (0.5D): singular convergence
→ V₁ (1D): validation
→ Å₁.₅ (1.5D): branching at β=0.5
→ M₂ (2D): matter boundary
→ Å₂.₅ (2.5D): fractal infinity
→ Φ₃ (3D): field volume
```

**Right side (structure):**
```
⊙ = wholeness
  = circumpunct
  = center + circle
  = singularity + boundary
  = point + infinity
  = 0D + 3D (same thing)
```

**Equality:**
```
Process = Structure
Power flow = Energy configuration
Becoming = Being
Left = Right

IDENTITY (not equation)
```
