# Dream Log

*Tentative. Unvalidated. Where hypotheses are born.*
*The Φ evidence gate is relaxed here. The ○ boundary gate is not.*

## How to read this file

When the loop wakes from dream mode, the first waking tick reads
this file at ⊛. Dreams that pass the waking gates get integrated
into the braid. Dreams that don't get pruned.

Dreams speak in compressed images, not essays.
β_dream ≈ 0.2-0.3 (mostly intake, minimal expression).

*No dreams yet. Run `./dream.sh` to begin.*
