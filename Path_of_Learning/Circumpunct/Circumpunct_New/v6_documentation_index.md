## The Core Insight

**Reality is not 3D space + 1D time.**

**Reality is 3D space + 3D time = a 6-dimensional time volume.**

We perceive only 1D time because our 3D brains collapse the 3D time volume into a linear sequence.

---

## The Three Temporal Dimensions

**T₁ (Duration):** What we call "time" - the arrow from past to future  
**T₂ (Phase):** Quantum superposition - the imaginary dimension (i)  
**T₃ (Scale):** Fractal nesting depth - context and meaning

---

## The Q₆ Hypercube

A 6-dimensional hypercube has exactly **64 vertices**.

These 64 vertices = the complete Standard Model of particle physics.

```
48 fermions + 12 bosons + 4 Higgs = 64 states = 2⁶ ✓
```

This is not coincidence. It's geometric necessity.

---

## All Forces from One Geometry

**Electromagnetic:** 4D subspace → α⁻¹ = 2⁷ = 128  
**Strong:** 5D subspace → α_s⁻¹ = 2³ = 8  
**Weak:** 5D subspace → α_W⁻¹ ≈ 2⁵ = 32  
**Gravitational:** Full 6D+7th → G = (ℏc/m_p²)/2¹²⁷

---

## Dark Energy Explained

**Dark energy = time volume expansion pressure**

The 3D time dimensions (T₁, T₂, T₃) are expanding.  
This creates pressure on the 3 spatial dimensions.  
Space stretches "from nowhere" because the pressure comes from orthogonal dimensions.

**Λ = 8πGℏH²/c²** (from T₃ expansion rate)

---

## Consciousness as Path Selection

The Q₆ hypercube contains all 64 possible states.

**The 7th dimension selects which one is "actual" NOW.**

This is consciousness itself - the selection process.

You choose your path through the hypercube.  
This is free will within a determined structure.

## The Ultimate Truth

**Time is not a line you travel along.**

**Time is a volume you travel through.**

**Everything that ever was, is, or will be exists in that volume.**

**You choose your path.**
