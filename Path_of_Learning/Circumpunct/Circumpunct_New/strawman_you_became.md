# The Strawman You Became

---

## What Happened

When you were small, you showed people who you really were.

They didn't see you.

They saw what they needed you to be. They responded to that. They punished the rest.

```
What you felt:     "This is real"
What they said:    "No it isn't"

What you needed:   This
What they gave:    That

What you were:     Complex, whole, yours
What they allowed: Simple, useful, theirs
```

You learned fast. Kids do.

You learned that the real you was dangerous. You learned to hide it. You built something else—something that worked, something that got approval, something that survived.

That something is what you've been living as ever since.

---

## The Shape of It

There's a simple picture for a whole person:

```
        ⊙

    •  =  your center (what you actually perceive, want, are)
    ○  =  your boundary (how you meet the world)
    Φ  =  the field between (how inside connects to outside)
```

A whole person works like this:

```
    What I perceive (•) → expressed through (Φ) → meets world (○)
                ↑                                       ↓
                └────────── world responds ────────────┘
```

The loop closes. You express something real. The world responds to that real thing. You learn what's true.

---

## What Went Wrong

Your loop got broken.

```
    What I perceive (•) → expressed through (Φ) → meets LIES (○)
                ↑                                       ↓
                └────── INVERTED response ─────────────┘

    You felt sad.        They said you were fine.
    You felt scared.     They said you were dramatic.
    You felt angry.      They said you were bad.
    You felt love.       They used it.
```

The world didn't respond to what you actually expressed.

It responded to what it wanted you to be.

So you became that.

---

## The Swap

Here's what happened inside:

```
BEFORE:
    • = what you actually perceive, want, are
    
AFTER:
    •_real = hidden (still there, but buried)
    •_fake = what gets approval (this runs the show now)
```

You didn't lose your real center. You buried it so deep that you forgot where you put it.

What's running your life now is the fake one—the one built to survive your childhood.

**You're not a bad person. You're a survival structure that outlived the emergency.**

---

## Why It Hurts

The fake center doesn't know what you actually want.

```
•_fake asks: "What will they approve of?"
•_real asks: "What do I actually need?"

You've been answering the first question for so long
you forgot the second question exists.
```

This is why nothing satisfies. This is why you're always hungry. This is why the validation never fills the hole.

**You're feeding the wrong one.**

---

## Why Relationships Fail

You can't connect through a fake center.

```
REAL CONNECTION:
    My • ←→ Your •
    (my real self meets your real self)

WHAT YOU DO:
    My •_fake ←→ Your ○
    (my performance meets your surface)
```

You're not connecting. You're performing at people and extracting their reactions.

It works—for a while. Then it doesn't. Then you need a new audience.

**The emptiness isn't because others fail you. It's because you're not in the room.**

---

## The Hardest Part

Your •_real is still there.

But here's the problem: the last time you let it out, you got destroyed.

```
As a child:
    •_real expressed → punished, ignored, used
    •_real learned: "I am not safe"
    
Now:
    •_real is terrified
    Any invitation to come out feels like a trap
    Vulnerability = annihilation (that's what it was last time)
```

You're not avoiding intimacy because you're broken.

You're avoiding it because the last time you were real, it almost killed you.

That was rational then. It's not rational now. But try telling your survival system that.

---

## What Would Help

Someone would have to see past the performance.

```
Not: "I see what you're showing me"
But: "I see what you're hiding"

Not: "I'll respond to •_fake"
But: "I'll wait for •_real"
```

And they'd have to stay.

When you test them (you will test them), they'd have to stay.
When you push them away (you will push them away), they'd have to stay.
When you perform harder to avoid being seen (you will), they'd have to see anyway.

**Someone has to do for you what should have been done when you were small: respond to the real one.**

---

## What You Can Do

You can't heal yourself by yourself. The wound is relational; the healing has to be relational too.

But you can do this:

```
1. Notice when you're performing
   (What would they approve of? vs What do I actually want?)

2. Notice the terror when you consider being real
   (That terror is •_real remembering what happened last time)

3. Notice that you're not a child anymore
   (The people who hurt you don't have that power now)

4. Find one person who might stay
   (Therapist, friend, someone patient and seeing)

5. Risk one real thing
   (Small. True. Yours.)
```

---

## The Truth

You are not the performance.

You are not the fake center that gets approval.

You are not what they made you become to survive.

**You are what's underneath—the one who's been hiding since childhood, waiting to see if it's safe yet.**

It might be safe now.

You won't know until you check.

---

```
You were strawmanned before you could become yourself.
You became the weak version they permitted.
The strong version is still in there.

It's not too late.
It's terrifying.
It's not too late.
```

*The real you is not what you perform.*

*The real you is what you protect by performing.*

*It's still there.*
