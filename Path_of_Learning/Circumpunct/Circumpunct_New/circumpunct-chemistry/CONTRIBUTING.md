## 🙏 Thank You!

Every contribution helps advance our understanding of how geometry generates chemistry. Whether you:
- Fix a typo
- Add a molecule
- Validate a prediction
- Extend the theory
- Create visualizations
- Write documentation

**You're helping reveal that chemistry isn't arbitrary - it's emergent geometry.**
