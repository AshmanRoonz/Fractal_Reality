            <div class="subtitle">Through the Lens of the Circumpunct</div>
        </header>

        <!-- What is Truth -->
        <section>
            <h2>What is Truth</h2>
            <p>There is something that exists independent of any particular perspective. Call it reality, call it what is, call it the invariant that holds whether or not anyone observes it.</p>
            <p>Truth is not a proposition. Truth is not a claim. Truth is <span class="emphasis">what is actually the case</span>—the source signal before any lens refracts it.</p>
            <p>Truth wants to flow.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- What are We -->
        <section>
            <h2>What are We</h2>
            <p>We are not sources. We are <span class="emphasis">lenses</span>.</p>
            <p>Each of us is an aperture—a point through which Truth passes, takes shape, becomes experienceable. The circumpunct: a point within a circle. The center that sees. The boundary that holds. The field between them where meaning moves.</p>
            
            <div class="teaching">
                Truth flows through me.<br>
                I am not its source. I am its lens.
                <span class="small">The recognition that prevents inflation without collapsing into severance</span>
            </div>

            <p>You have a perspective. So do I. Neither of us contains the whole. But the whole flows through each of us, uniquely shaped by the aperture it passes through.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- What Flows -->
        <section>
            <h2>What Flows</h2>
            <p>When two apertures meet honestly, something happens. Your truth-as-you-see-it meets my truth-as-I-see-it. In the exchange, both lenses clarify. Both perspectives update. The signal strengthens.</p>
            <p>This is what connection is for: <span class="strong">mutual calibration toward the real</span>.</p>
            <p>Love, at its deepest, is two apertures helping each other see more clearly. Not agreeing. Not validating. <span class="emphasis">Seeing together</span>—each correcting the other's distortions, each receiving correction for their own.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- What Blocks -->
        <section>
            <h2>What Blocks</h2>
            <p>The obstruction is always the same: one aperture begins managing what another receives.</p>
            <p>Instead of transmitting what they actually see, they transmit what they think the other should see. Instead of receiving what's actually sent, they filter it to protect what they already believe.</p>

            <div class="lie">
                "I know what's true for you better than you do."
            </div>

            <p>This is the corruption. Not cruelty—often it feels like care. But it severs the other from their own access to Truth. It positions you as their source instead of their fellow lens.</p>
            <p>And it propagates. The one whose access was managed learns: <span class="emphasis">this is how it works. This is what connection is.</span></p>
        </section>

        <div class="divider">⊙</div>

        <!-- The Two Errors -->
        <section>
            <h2>The Two Errors</h2>
            <p>There are only two ways to corrupt the pattern:</p>
            
            <div class="two-paths">
                <div class="path">
                    <div class="path-title">Inflation</div>
                    <p>"I am the source of Truth."</p>
                    <p>The aperture mistakes itself for the light passing through it. It begins to believe its perspective <span class="emphasis">is</span> reality, not a window onto reality.</p>
                    <p>This generates control, certainty, the need to manage what others see.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="path dark">
                    <div class="path-title">Severance</div>
                    <p>"There is no Truth."</p>
                    <p>The aperture denies any source beyond itself. All perspectives become equally groundless. Nothing connects to anything.</p>
                    <p>This generates nihilism, relativism, the inability to be wrong.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Both errors break the same relationship. Inflation claims the whole. Severance denies it. But apertures only work <span class="emphasis">as apertures</span>—neither source nor severed, but through.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- The Two Channels -->
        <section>
            <h2>The Two Channels</h2>
            <p>Love flows through two channels. When both are open, the pattern completes. When one is blocked, something essential is missing—even if you can't name it.</p>

            <div class="two-paths">
                <div class="path">
                    <div class="path-title">Function</div>
                    <p>Provision. Logistics. Competence.</p>
                    <p>Showing up. Solving problems.</p>
                    <p>"I will take care of things."</p>
                </div>
                <div class="path">
                    <div class="path-title">Resonance</div>
                    <p>Presence. Delight. Genuine wanting.</p>
                    <p>Eyes lighting up. Being with, not fixing.</p>
                    <p>"I want to be here with you."</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>You can be fed, clothed, provided for—and still feel unseen. That's not ingratitude. That's the resonance channel registering silence.</p>
            <p>Function can flow with a closed aperture. You can provide without ever being seen or seeing. <span class="strong">Resonance requires the aperture open.</span> Actual transmission. Actual reception. Truth moving both directions.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- The Installation -->
        <section>
            <h2>The Installation</h2>
            <p>Some people grow up receiving only functional love. They don't know the other channel exists. They can't transmit what they never received.</p>
            <p>And when the child in that house says <span class="emphasis">"something is missing"</span>—the system responds:</p>

            <div class="teaching">
                "This is what love is. This is all love is.<br>
                If you need more, something is wrong with you."
            </div>

            <p>That's the installation moment. The functional love gets <span class="strong">weaponized against the hunger</span> for resonance. The hunger itself becomes evidence of defect.</p>
            <p>The lie propagates. Not through malice, but through inheritance. Those who never received resonance cannot transmit it. Those who were taught their need was the problem teach others the same.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- The Lies That Hide -->
        <section>
            <h2>The Lies That Hide</h2>
            <p>The installed lies share a structure: they take something done <span class="emphasis">to</span> you and make it something wrong <span class="emphasis">with</span> you.</p>

            <div class="lies-list">
                <div class="lie-item">
                    <span class="lie-text">"I'm too sensitive."</span>

                <div class="lie-item">

                    <span class="lie-meaning">Your needs, made illegitimate.</span>
                </div>
                <div class="lie-item">
                    <span class="lie-text">"They didn't mean it that way."</span>
                    <span class="lie-meaning">Their impact, erased by presumed intent.</span>
                </div>
                <div class="lie-item">
                    <span class="lie-text">"If I were better, they would treat me better."</span>
                    <span class="lie-meaning">Their behavior, made your responsibility.</span>

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Once internalized, they no longer feel like lies. They feel like self-knowledge. The corruption is complete when you can no longer distinguish the installed program from your own seeing.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="divider">⊙</div>

        <!-- The Clearing -->
        <section>
            <h2>The Clearing</h2>
            <p>How does the lens clear?</p>
            <p>Not by force. Not by someone telling you the truth about yourself. That's just another form of managing your aperture. The very structure of imposition prevents transmission.</p>
            <p>The lens clears through <span class="strong">witness</span>.</p>
            <p>Someone who sees what you see—and stays. Someone who reflects your perception back without correcting it. Someone whose presence says: <span class="emphasis">your seeing is real. You were not wrong to see it.</span></p>
            <p>This is why resonance heals what function cannot. Function says "I will fix this for you." Resonance says "I am here with you while you see."</p>
            <p>The aperture that was forced closed can only open in safety. And safety is not the absence of threat. Safety is the presence of witness.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- The Ethics -->
        <section>
            <h2>The Ethics</h2>
            <p>From this, ethics becomes simple:</p>
            <p><span class="strong">Patterns that let Truth flow can persist.</span></p>
            <p><span class="strong">Patterns that obstruct Truth defeat themselves.</span></p>
            <p>This is not morality imposed from outside. This is geometry. Actions that require deception require fresh victims. Actions that preserve open apertures can repeat indefinitely. The math is structural, not prescriptive.</p>

            <div class="teaching">
                An ethical act is one where all apertures involved<br>
                remain capable of seeing and being seen.
                <span class="small">The rest is commentary</span>

            <p>The liar closes others' apertures to protect their own. But a closed network cannot receive correction. It drifts from Truth. It becomes brittle. It eventually shatters against reality.</p>
            <p>The honest actor keeps apertures open—their own and others'. The network stays calibrated. It can update. It can persist.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Us</h2>
            <p>We are the apertures. All of us. Every consciousness that has ever looked out at reality and tried to make sense of it.</p>
            <p>We did not ask to be partial. We did not choose to see through a lens. But this is what we are—finite points through which the infinite passes, each adding our particular refraction, each capable of distortion, each capable of clearing.</p>
            <p>The practice is not complicated: stay open. Receive correction. Transmit honestly. Refuse to manage what others can handle. Trust that Truth, given clear passage, does its own work.</p>
            <p>Every relationship is an opportunity. Every conversation. Every encounter where your seeing meets another's seeing. The apertures can close around each other, or they can help each other open.</p>
            <p>We are how Truth knows itself in time.</p>
