        </header>

        <section class="section">
            <p>I walked into Energy Martial Arts Academy in Pickering, Ontario at twenty-nine years old. I didn't know what I was looking for. Maybe discipline. Maybe confidence. Maybe just something to do with my body that wasn't sitting at a desk.</p>

            <p>What I found was Varpet Ed Saki—and a philosophy that would reshape how I understand authority, teaching, and love.</p>

            <p><span class="emphasis">Varpet</span> is Armenian for "master." Ed is Armenian-born, Canadian-raised, and the co-owner of an academy that has shaped hundreds of students over the years. The art he teaches is called <span class="emphasis">Nerkin Ouj</span>—"Inner Power"—a mixed martial art delivered in a formal Korean-style academy setting.</p>

            <p>But the name tells you everything. The power isn't in the kick. It's in what the kick reveals about who you're becoming.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="symbol-divider">◆ ◇ ◆</div>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>The Vessel, Not the Contents</h2>

            <p>Early in my training, Varpet said something that I didn't fully understand until years later:</p>

            <div class="varpet-quote">
                "Martial arts is just a vessel for raising good humans."
                <span class="speaker">— Varpet Ed Saki</span>
            </div>

            <p>At the time, I heard it as a nice sentiment. A way of saying the academy wasn't just about fighting. But the longer I trained—and especially after I earned my black belt at thirty-three and began teaching alongside him—the more I understood what he actually meant.</p>

            <p>The forms, the techniques, the belt progression, the discipline—none of it was the point. All of it was <span class="emphasis">structure in service of something deeper</span>.</p>

            <p>The vessel holds the water. It shapes the water. But you don't drink the vessel.</p>

            <p>Varpet wasn't teaching us to fight. He was teaching us to <span class="emphasis">be</span>.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Hard and Soft</h2>

            <p>Every martial artist eventually encounters the distinction between "hard" and "soft" styles. Hard styles emphasize power, structure, direct force. Soft styles emphasize flow, redirection, yielding to overcome.</p>

            <p>What I learned from Varpet is that mastery isn't choosing one or the other. <span class="emphasis">Mastery is knowing when to use which.</span></p>

            <div class="two-column">
                <div class="column-box">
                    <h4>The Hard</h4>
                    <p>Structure. Discipline. Precision. The formal bow. The crisp technique. The standard that doesn't bend because you're tired. This is the container that makes growth possible.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="column-box">
                    <h4>The Soft</h4>
                    <p>Presence. Attunement. Flow. The encouraging word. The patience with a struggling student. The adaptation to what this moment actually needs. This is the warmth that fills the container.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>I watched Varpet move between these modes seamlessly. In one moment, he would hold a student to exacting standards—no sloppiness, no shortcuts, no excuses. In the next moment, he would kneel down, look a discouraged child in the eyes, and say exactly what they needed to hear to try again.</p>

            <p>He wasn't switching between two different approaches. He was <span class="emphasis">reading what the moment required</span> and responding with precision.</p>

            <p>That's not a technique. That's wisdom.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>You Can't Do That Here</h2>

            <p>One of the most important things I learned from Varpet wasn't about martial arts at all. It was about correction.</p>

            <p>When a child acted out—pushed another student, disrupted class, crossed a line—Varpet's response was always the same:</p>

            <div class="varpet-quote">
                "You can't do that here."

            <p>Not "you're a bad kid." Not "what's wrong with you?" Not shame. Not character assassination.</p>

            <p>Just: <span class="emphasis">the behavior is unacceptable in this space.</span></p>

            <p>This distinction might seem small. It isn't. It's everything.</p>

            <h2>Stay Strong, Ash</h2>

            <p>For five years after earning my black belt, I worked at Energy Martial Arts Academy—running summer camps, assisting with evening adult classes, going through Varpet's leadership training program.</p>

            <p>The leadership training deserves its own mention. It wasn't about management techniques or public speaking tips. It was about <span class="emphasis">who you are when you're responsible for others</span>. How you hold space. How you model what you're teaching. How you stay grounded when things get chaotic.</p>

            <p>And throughout all of it, whenever I was struggling—with a difficult student, with my own doubt, with the weight of trying to become someone worth following—Varpet would look at me and say:</p>

            <div class="varpet-quote">
                "Stay strong, Ash."
                <span class="speaker">— Varpet Ed Saki</span>
            </div>

            <p>Three words. But they landed differently every time.</p>

            <p>Sometimes they meant: <em>You can handle this. Don't give up.</em></p>

            <p>Sometimes they meant: <em>I see you're tired. Keep going anyway.</em></p>

            <p>Sometimes they meant: <em>I believe in you. Now believe in yourself.</em></p>

            <p>What never changed was the underlying message: <span class="emphasis">strength isn't the absence of struggle. Strength is what you find inside the struggle.</span></p>

            <h2>What Mastery Actually Looks Like</h2>

            <p>I've thought a lot about what made Varpet different from other teachers I've had. And I think it comes down to this:</p>

            <p><span class="emphasis">He made everyone feel welcome and empowered. Always.</span></p>

            <p>Not welcomed despite their limitations. Not empowered after they proved themselves. From the moment you walked through the door—whether you were an anxious child, an out-of-shape adult, a natural athlete, or someone who'd been told their whole life they weren't coordinated enough for this—you belonged.</p>

            <p>And that belonging wasn't permissive. It came with standards. It came with expectations. It came with the clear message that you were capable of more than you believed.</p>

            <div class="quote-block">
                The greatest teachers don't lower the bar to make you feel good about where you are. They hold the bar high while making you believe you can reach it.
            </div>

            <p>That balance—high standards AND unconditional welcome—is rare. Most people can do one or the other. Varpet did both, simultaneously, with everyone who trained under him.</p>

            <p>That's not a technique you learn. That's a way of being you grow into.</p>

            <h2>The Vessel I'm Trying to Become</h2>

            <p>I left active training years ago. Life moved on—marriage, fatherhood, career changes, the thousand small redirections that shape an adult life.</p>

            <p>But what Varpet taught me didn't leave. It became part of how I see authority, teaching, correction, and care.</p>

            <p>When I work with children in my role as an Educational Assistant, I hear his voice: <em>You can't do that here.</em> Focus on behavior. Preserve the center.</p>

            <p>When I'm exhausted and my son needs me to show up anyway, I hear: <em>Stay strong, Ash.</em></p>

            <p>When I'm developing frameworks for understanding relationships and ethics, I find myself returning to the same insight: <span class="emphasis">the structure exists to serve the human, not the other way around.</span></p>

            <p>Martial arts was just a vessel. But the water it carried—the lessons about presence, about the balance of hard and soft, about holding standards while honoring dignity—that water is still flowing through everything I do.</p>
