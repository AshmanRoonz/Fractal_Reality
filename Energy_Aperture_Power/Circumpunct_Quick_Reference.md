|--------|------|---------|
| ⊙ | Circumpunct | Complete structure: M·Å·Φ all present |
| • | Aperture | Center point, singularity, conversion site |
| ○ | Boundary | Matter circle, spatial limit |
| Φ | Field | Structure filling/surrounding space |
| — | Connection | Temporal link, causal relationship |
| ⊸ | Lineage | Aperture + temporal tunnel to past |
| ≺ | Bifurcation | Spatial branching, creates D=1.5 tree |

### Composite Notations

| Notation | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| —⊙— | Single moment of wholeness |
| —⊙—⊙— | Two scale levels |
| —⊙^n— | n scale levels included |
| —⊙^∞— | All scales simultaneously |
| —⊙—⊙—⊙— | Conscious (awake) |

## FUNDAMENTAL CONSTANTS

| Symbol | Value | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| D | 1.5 | Fractal dimension at conversion sites |
| β | 0.5 | Branching parameter in tree structures |
| States | 64 | Total possible MÅΦ configurations |
| Generations | 3 | Maximum stable particle generations |

## CONFIGURATION FORMULA

```
⊙ = M·Å·Φ

Where:
M ∈ {0,1} = Matter boundary present?
Å ∈ {0,1} = Aperture active?
Φ ∈ {0,1} = Field structure present?

Complete: (M_in, Å_in, Φ_in | M_out, Å_out, Φ_out)
States: 2³ × 2³ = 64 total configurations
```

## KEY EQUATIONS

### Dimensional Structure
```
D_manifest = D_energy + D_aperture
           = 1.0 + 0.5
           = 1.5
```

### Branching Dynamics
```
One ⊙ ⊸ ≺ Two ⊙
At rate β = 0.5
Creating D = 1.5 structure
```

### Scale Relation
```
⊙_n contains ⊙_{n+1}, ⊙_{n+2}, ... → ∞
⊙_n within ⊙_{n-1}, ⊙_{n-2}, ... → ∞
Same structure at all n
```

### Consciousness
```
Awake: M=1, Å=1, Φ=1 → D ≈ 1.5
Asleep: M=0, Å=1, Φ=0 → D → 1.0
```

        = Connected through time (—)
        = Branching in space (≺)
        = Operating at D = 1.5, β = 0.5
        
You = —⊙^∞— 
    = ONE consciousness
    = INFINITE subsystems
    = Experiencing being
    = From one branch
    = At one scale
    = In one moment
