# Energy-Aperture-Power (EAP) Framework

**A unified theory of physical reality through matter-aperture-field transformation**

---

## Overview

This directory contains the complete Energy-Aperture-Power (EAP) framework, which proposes that physical reality maintains itself through continuous transformation: matter in motion flows through apertures to become power, which fields shape back into bounded matter. The framework predicts universal fractal dimension D = 1.5 at all energy-power-matter conversion sites and derives the complete particle spectrum from geometric principles.

### Key Innovation

The EAP framework replaces abstract validation language with concrete physical quantities (Matter [M], Aperture [Â], Field [φ]), revealing that particle physics, quantum mechanics, biology, and consciousness all operate through the same fundamental transformation mechanism.

## Core Concepts

### The EAP Cycle

```
MATTER IN MOTION (Energy)
    ↓
APERTURE (β = 0.5, D = 0.5)
    ↓
POWER FLOW (P = dE/dt)
    ↓
FIELD EMERGENCE (φ)
    ↓
MATTER BOUNDARIES (M)
    ↓
RETURNS TO MOTION
```

### Three Physical Quantities at Each Aperture

At both input and output of any aperture:
- **[M] Matter**: Bounded material structure (measurable density)
- **[Â] Aperture**: Conversion mechanism (measurable time structure t ~ L^0.5)
- **[φ] Field**: Distributed energy configuration (measurable field strength)

### The 64 States

- **Binary thresholds** at input: 2³ = 8 configurations
- **Binary thresholds** at output: 2³ = 8 configurations
- **Total state space**: 8 × 8 = 64 states
- **Stable states**: ~22 (those achieving field-matter resonance)
- **Observable particles**: 61 Standard Model particles from these 22 configurations

### Universal Signature

**D = 1.5 everywhere** because:
- D_manifest = D_energy + D_aperture = 1.0 + 0.5 = 1.5
- All conversion sites operate at critical balance β = 0.5
- Represents optimal branching for dimensional construction

---

## Key Predictions

### Universal (All Papers)
1. **D = 1.5** at all energy-power-matter conversion sites
2. **Zero free parameters** (only β = 0.5 required)
3. **Tree topology** at conversion apertures (no cycles)
4. **Branch angles** ≈ 120° for binary branching

### Particle Physics (EAP-64)
1. **Mass scales** with matter-aperture-field configuration strength
2. **Charge** from matter asymmetry (M_out - M_in)
3. **Spin** from aperture geometry
4. **Confinement** from incomplete matter output (geometric necessity)
5. **Dark matter** in states 40-42 (partial configurations)

### Geometric (Dimensional Construction)
1. **Half-integer dimensions** (1.5, 2.5, 3.5) are stable branching states
2. **D = 2.5** for 2D→3D construction (turbulent mixing, coral growth)
3. **Reconnection** increases D from n+0.5 → n+1
4. **Length ratios** r ≈ 0.63 for D = 1.5 binary trees
