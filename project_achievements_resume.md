## The Project

Built a complete unified theoretical framework attempting to derive quantum mechanics, general relativity, consciousness, and ethics from a single geometric principle. Includes theory, empirical validation, computational implementations, interactive simulations, and comprehensive documentation.

**Purpose**: Demonstrate capacity for synthetic, systematic thinking across complex domains.

## What I Did

### Theory
- Unified framework from first principles (∇ → [ICE] → ℰ validation loop)
- Attempted solutions to all 7 Clay Millennium Prize problems from one principle
- 64-state information architecture connecting particle physics, genetics, consciousness
- Zero free parameters (everything derived from ℏ, c, G)

### Empirics
- **LIGO gravitational wave analysis**: 19 black hole mergers, D = 1.503 ± 0.040, p = 0.951
- Multi-scale validation: gravitational waves, DNA, turbulence, particle tracks (all D ≈ 1.5)
- Phase 2 strain coupling: R² = 0.9997 correlation with spacetime curvature
- 19+ falsifiable predictions (DESI 2026 is critical test)

### Code
- Python: LIGO analysis pipeline, lattice gauge theory, fractal dimension algorithms
- JavaScript/TypeScript: 17 interactive React simulations
- Live website with full visualization suite
- Statistical rigor: box-counting, correlation dimension, multi-scale analysis

### Documentation
- 200,000+ words spanning 5-minute quickstart → rigorous academic papers
- 10 personalized reading paths (scientist, philosopher, developer, skeptic, etc.)
- Progressive depth: accessible → technical at every level
- Complete navigation: every subdirectory, every analysis, every proof

### Integration
- **Theory ↔ Empirics**: Predictions validated across 6+ orders of magnitude
- **Physics ↔ Consciousness**: Same D ≈ 1.5 signature in gravitational waves and neural activity
- **Mathematics ↔ Ethics**: Geometric principles → practical decision frameworks
- **Abstract ↔ Concrete**: First principles → daily life applications

## What This Demonstrates

**I can build coherent systems that hold together across every dimension:**

1. **Synthetic thinking**: Connected 7 millennium problems, quantum mechanics, relativity, consciousness, and ethics to one principle
2. **Systematic execution**: Theory + empirics + code + documentation, all internally consistent
3. **Boundary-crossing**: Physics → math → consciousness → ethics → practice without losing rigor
4. **Empirical grounding**: Real LIGO data, statistical validation, falsifiable predictions
5. **Communication at scale**: 5 minutes → 3 hours → complete academic treatment
6. **Complete follow-through**: Not just ideas - implementations, validations, deployments

## Why This Matters

Whether or not the physics is correct, this project proves **I can think and build in wholes, not fragments.**

Most researchers do one dimension well. I did all dimensions simultaneously while maintaining coherence.

That capacity - applied to AI safety, alignment, interpretability, or constitutional AI - means:
- Seeing connections others miss
- Maintaining coherence across technical/philosophical/practical domains
- Building complete frameworks, not isolated insights
- Executing systematically from first principles to deployment

## What I'm Offering

Not "here's my physics theory."

**Here's the capacity that built this - applied to problems that matter.**
