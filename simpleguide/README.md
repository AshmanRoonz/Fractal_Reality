## 💡 USAGE TIPS

### Tip 1: Start Small
Don't try to absorb everything at once. Quick Start → decide → proceed.

### Tip 2: Follow Your Interest
Navigation guide shows ten different paths. Pick what resonates.

### Tip 3: It's Okay to Skip
Complete guide is modular. Jump to interesting parts. Cross-reference later.

### Tip 4: Test As You Go
Don't just read. Apply [ICE] validation. Check LIGO data. See if it works.

### Tip 5: Ask Questions
Framework is falsifiable. If something doesn't make sense, investigate. Don't just accept.

### Tip 6: Share and Discuss
Understanding deepens through teaching and dialogue. Discuss with others.

### Tip 7: Return for Depth
First pass = understanding. Second pass = integration. Third pass = mastery.
