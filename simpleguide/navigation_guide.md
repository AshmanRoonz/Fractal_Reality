2. **Part 7** → Understand how this solves all 7 Clay Millennium Problems
3. **Part 3** → Grasp why β = 0.5 → D = 1.5 is structural
4. **Part 13** → Review falsification criteria
5. **Part 15** → Access the repository and verify yourself

**What you'll care about:**
- p = 0.951 statistical confidence
- 35+ orders of magnitude validation

- Asking hard questions

**Healthy skepticism DOESN'T mean:**
- Dismissing without investigation
- Assuming it's wrong because it's new
- Ignoring empirical evidence
- Refusing to engage with ideas

### You Can Start Anywhere

The guide is comprehensive but modular. You don't have to read linearly.

Jump to what interests you. Cross-reference as needed. Return for depth later.

**There's no wrong way to learn** as long as you're engaging honestly with the material.

## 🌟 **FINAL ADVICE**

**Don't believe anything just because it's written here.**

Test it:
- Check the LIGO data
- Apply [ICE] to your life
- Verify the math
- See if predictions hold
- Notice if it helps

**If it's true, reality will confirm it.**  
**If it's false, reality will contradict it.**

That's how knowledge works.

**Now choose your path and begin.** ✨
