v4.1 changes
- Fix batch error: 'cannot unpack non-iterable float object' when the 35–350 Hz band
  is empty for a window. spectral_flatness() now ALWAYS returns a tuple
  (flatness, f, Pxx) and never a bare float.
- Adaptive Welch window: nperseg = min(1024, max(256, len(window)//2))
  to handle very short windows.
- If 35–350 Hz band is empty, fall back to full spectrum (f > 0).
